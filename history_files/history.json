Think of it as a peep through a 100-year-old royal dollhouse!\n\n3. Ukraine is grappling with how to beef up their army ranks. It's a seriously heated debate about potentially expanding their military draft, given they're quite worn out.\n\n4. Finland has welcomed in Alexander Stubb as President in what's being referred to as the 'NATO Era'. He's a center-right kind of guy and he'll be handling Finland's foreign policy at a time when everyone's getting a bit nervous about Russia.\n\n5.

They've retired their old chatbot, Bard, and replaced it with a shiny new A.I.-driven chatbot and voice assistant named Gemini. It's all part of their race to compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\n3. Google's also joined an effort to identify content generated by A.I., not dissimilar from a plan Meta revealed just two days before. Silicon Valley seems to be taking the A.I. issue seriously.\n\n4. Apple's first headset, Vision Pro, may look swanky but it seems to fall short on performance and purpose. The $3,500 goggles can't replace your regular work laptop, and they also seem to give some people motion sickness.\n\n5. Over in Pakistan, A.I. played a big part in the election season. Particularly when Imran Khan gave a 'victory speech' from jail - it was seen as both an exciting use of technology and a worrying sign of potential abuse of power.\n\nAnd that's your tech wrap-up!"

He's urging world leaders not to question when the war will end but instead ask why Russia is still able to wage it.\n\nThe Ukrainian forces are in a tough spot right now. They are outmanned and outgunned, putting them in arguably their most precarious position since the war began.\n\nOver in Africa, there's some family drama with a twist of royalty. A student is promising to overthrow one of the continent's last ruling monarchs. But there's a hitch - his father is a soldier sworn to protect this very throne.

This comes as a $60.1 billion military aid bill is currently stuck in the House.\n\n3. Over in Michigan, the Republican nominating process appears to be headed towards chaos with two competing nominating conventions on March 2nd for the party's presidential contest.\n\n4. Former president Jimmy Carter is nearing a year in hospice care at nearly 100 years old, once again surprising people with his longevity.\n\n5.

She's built up a loyal following by balancing being a prankster and a product merchandiser. So, it's like she's asking, \"am I joking with these clothes?\" Quite a unique approach, right?  \n\nNext up, actress and '90s model Jaime King is opening up about her past and future in an interesting journey of self-discovery.\n\nDid you hear about Beyonc\u00e9 in Bushwick? She was there for Luar, a brand you'll probably be hearing a lot more about soon.\n\nLastly, we're seeing a step towards inclusivity with one fashion label daring to cast women over 40 in their runway shows.
